## 1. Software Development Life Cycle Phases
*   **Planning**: Requirements gathering, feasibility study, project planning
*   **Analysis**: Detailed requirements analysis, system modeling
*   **Design**: System architecture, database design, UI/UX design
*   **Implementation**: Coding, unit testing, integration
*   **Testing**: System testing, user acceptance testing, performance testing
*   **Deployment**: Production deployment, rollout strategy
*   **Maintenance**: Bug fixes, enhancements, ongoing support

## 2. Requirements Engineering
*   **Elicitation**: Stakeholder interviews, surveys, workshops
*   **Analysis**: Requirement categorization, conflict resolution
*   **Specification**: Clear, unambiguous requirement documentation
*   **Validation**: Review and approval of requirements
*   **Management**: Version control, traceability, change control

## 3. Design Principles
*   **Modularity**: Decompose system into manageable modules
*   **Abstraction**: Hide complex implementation details
*   **Encapsulation**: Bundle data and methods together
*   **Separation of Concerns**: Divide system into distinct sections
*   **Information Hiding**: Restrict access to internal workings

## 4. Implementation Standards
*   **Coding Standards**: Follow established coding guidelines
*   **Code Reviews**: Peer review all code changes
*   **Version Control**: Use Git with established branching strategy
*   **Continuous Integration**: Automate build and testing
*   **Documentation**: Inline comments and external documentation

## 5. Quality Assurance
*   **Testing Strategy**: Unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing
*   **Test Automation**: Automate regression testing
*   **Code Coverage**: Maintain minimum coverage thresholds
*   **Performance Testing**: Load, stress, and scalability testing
*   **Security Testing**: Vulnerability assessment and penetration testing

## 6. Deployment & Release Management
*   **Environment Management**: Consistent dev, test, staging, production environments
*   **Deployment Automation**: Scripted deployments with rollback capability
*   **Release Planning**: Coordinated release schedules
*   **Change Management**: Controlled change approval process
*   **Incident Management**: Issue tracking and resolution process

## 7. Maintenance & Support
*   **Bug Tracking**: Systematic issue reporting and resolution
*   **Enhancement Requests**: Process for feature requests
*   **Patch Management**: Regular security and bug fixes
*   **Performance Monitoring**: Ongoing system performance tracking
*   **Backup & Recovery**: Data protection and disaster recovery

## 8. Governance & Compliance
*   **Audit Trails**: Maintain records of all changes
*   **Regulatory Compliance**: Adhere to industry regulations
*   **Security Standards**: Implement security best practices
*   **Documentation Standards**: Maintain up-to-date documentation
*   **Training**: Ensure team competency in SDLC processes
