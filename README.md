# Core Protocols

**The Central Registry for Engineering Standards & Guidelines.**

This repository serves as the single source of truth for all engineering protocols, guidelines, and standards. It is organized into four core pillars, each maintained in its own feature branch before consolidation.

## 📚 Structure

### [01. Methodology](tree/feature/methodology/01-methodology)
*Strategic Frameworks & Process*
*   **SDLC Standards**: The lifecycle from concept to decommission.
*   **Agile Methodology**: Sprints, rituals, and roles.
*   **Project Management**: WBS, Charters, and Governance.
*   **ITIL Framework**: Service Operations and Incident Management.

### [02. GitOps & DevOps](tree/feature/gitops/02-gitops)
*Infrastructure & Automation*
*   **GitOps Dictionary**: Metadata standards (Labels, Milestones).
*   **Bootstrap Roadmap**: Zero-to-One project initialization.
*   **Automation Reference**: The Glass Factory Engine.
*   **CI/CD Pipelines**: Build, Test, Deploy standards.

### [03. Architecture](tree/feature/architecture/03-architecture)
*System Design & Patterns*
*   **Microservices**: Decomposition and communication patterns.
*   **API Design**: REST, GraphQL, and gRPC contracts.
*   **Data Persistence**: Database selection and modeling.
*   **UX Design**: Accessibility and interaction patterns.

### [04. Development](tree/feature/development-standards/04-development)
*Tactical Execution*
*   **Coding Standards**: Style guides and linting rules.
*   **Documentation**: Markdown, Diagrams, and API docs.
*   **Testing Strategy**: Unit, Integration, and E2E testing.
*   **Security**: Authentication, Authorization, and Encryption.
